            <h1 class="section-header">Training the Mind</h1>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">Put most simply, meditation is a way to train the mind. Most of the time, our minds are wandering — we’re thinking about the future, dwelling on the past, worrying, fantasizing, fretting or daydreaming. Meditation brings us back to the present moment, and gives us the tools we need to be less stressed, calmer and kinder to ourselves and others.</p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">“Meditation is a training of our attention,” Ms. Brach said. “It allows us to step out of distracted thought, and helps us arrive in the present moment in a balanced and clear way.”
            Mindfulness</p>
            <img src="img/training-the-mind.jpg" alt="training-the-mind" class="what-is__image">
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">There are lots of different types of meditation. Most religions have contemplative traditions, and there are plenty of secular ways to meditate, too. But in recent years, mindfulness meditation has become increasingly popular.</p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">Basic mindfulness meditation is the practice of paying attention to the present moment with an accepting, nonjudgmental disposition. The goal isn’t to stop thinking, or to empty the mind. Rather, the point is to pay close attention to your physical sensations, thoughts and emotions in order to see them more clearly, without making so many assumptions, or making up stories.</p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">It’s a deceptively simple exercise — just be right here, right now, without daydreaming. But with practice it can yield profound results, giving us greater control of our actions, and making room for more kindness and equanimity, even in difficult situations. With time, mindfulness meditation can even help us better understand what causes us stress, and what we can do to relieve it.</p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">Though mindfulness meditation was inspired by Buddhist practices, today it is available as a wholly secular practice that emphasizes stress reduction, the cultivation of focus and the development of tranquility.</p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">“There’s a misconception that mindfulness is religious,” said Mr. Smith. “What we have to explain is that it’s a stress reduction technique and a way to get yourself stronger mentally. It’s a self-care practice.”
            </p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">There’s a large and growing body of research identifying the measurable effects of mindfulness on the body and brain, and it is catching on in professional settings including education, sports, business and even the military.</p>
            <h3 class="what-is__header">Mindfulness vs. Meditation</h3>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">Though the words are sometimes used interchangeably, it’s useful to draw a distinction between mindfulness and meditation.
            </p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">Mindfulness is a quality of being — the experience of being open and aware in the present moment, without reflexive judgment, automatic criticism or mind wandering.</p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">Mindfulness meditation is the practice of actually being present in the moment, which in turn trains us to become more mindful throughout the day, particularly during difficult situations.
            </p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">As Ms. Brach puts it: “Mindfulness is your awareness of what’s going on in the present moment without any judgment. Meditation is the training of attention which cultivates that mindfulness.”</p>
            <p class="what-is_paragraph">Mindfulness meditation isn’t the only way to meditate. Transcendental Meditation, which aims to promote a state of relaxed awareness through the recitation of a mantra, is also popular these days. But in this guide, we’re focused on mindfulness, which is increasingly popular and easy to learn.</p>

            <p class="benefits_paragraph">

            <h1 class="section-header">How to Meditate?</h1>
            <p class="how-to__paragraph">Don't let the thought of meditating the "right" way add to your stress. If you choose to, you can attend special meditation centers or group classes led by trained instructors. But you can also practice meditation easily on your own. Or you may find apps to use, too.</p>
            <p class="how-to__paragraph">And you can make meditation as formal or informal as you like, however it suits your lifestyle and situation. Some people build meditation into their daily routine. For example, they may start and end each day with an hour of meditation. But all you really need is a few minutes of quality time for meditation.</p>
            <img src="img/how-to.jpg" alt="" class="how-to__image">
            <ul class="how-to-list">
                <h3 class="how-to-list__header">Here are some ways you can practice meditation on your own, whenever you choose:</h3>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Breathe deeply. This technique is good for beginners because breathing is a natural function.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Focus all your attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you inhale and exhale through your nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention wanders, gently return your focus to your breathing.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Scan your body. When using this technique, focus attention on different parts of your body. Become aware of your body's various sensations, whether that's pain, tension, warmth or relaxation.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Combine body scanning with breathing exercises and imagine breathing heat or relaxation into and out of different parts of your body.
                    Repeat a mantra. You can create your own mantra, whether it's religious or secular. Examples of religious mantras include the Jesus Prayer in the Christian tradition, the holy name of God in Judaism, or the om mantra of Hinduism, Buddhism and other Eastern religions.
                </li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Walk and meditate. Combining a walk with meditation is an efficient and healthy way to relax. You can use this technique anywhere you're walking, such as in a tranquil forest, on a city sidewalk or at the mall.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">When you use this method, slow down your walking pace so that you can focus on each movement of your legs or feet. Don't focus on a particular destination. Concentrate on your legs and feet, repeating action words in your mind such as "lifting," "moving" and "placing" as you lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your foot on the ground. Focus on the sights, sounds and smells around you.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Engage in prayer. Prayer is the best known and most widely practiced example of meditation. Spoken and written prayers are found in most faith traditions.
                </li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">You can pray using your own words or read prayers written by others. Check the self-help section of your local bookstore for examples. Talk with your rabbi, priest, pastor or other spiritual leader about possible resources.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Read and reflect. Many people report that they benefit from reading poems or sacred texts, and taking a few moments to quietly reflect on their meaning.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements"> You can also listen to sacred music, spoken words, or any music you find relaxing or inspiring. You may want to write your reflections in a journal or discuss them with a friend or spiritual leader.</li>
                <li class="how-to-list__elements">Focus your love and kindness. In this type of meditation, you think of others with feelings of love, compassion and kindness. This can help increase how connected you feel to others.</li>
                <p class="how-to__paragraph">Don't judge your meditation skills, which may only increase your stress. Meditation takes practice.
                </p>
                <p class="how-to__paragraph">Keep in mind, for instance, that it's common for your mind to wander during meditation, no matter how long you've been practicing meditation. If you're meditating to calm your mind and your attention wanders, slowly return to the object, sensation or movement you're focusing on.</p>
                <p class="how-to__paragraph">Experiment, and you'll likely find out what types of meditation work best for you and what you enjoy doing. Adapt meditation to your needs at the moment. Remember, there's no right way or wrong way to meditate. What matters is that meditation helps you reduce your stress and feel better overall.</p>
